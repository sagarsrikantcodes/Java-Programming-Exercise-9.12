(Geometry: intersecting point) Suppose two line segments intersect. The two endpoints for the first line segment are (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) 
and for the second line segment are (x3, y3) and (x4, y4). Write a program that prompts the user to enter these four endpoints and displays
the intersecting point. The intersecting point can be found by solving a linear equation. Use the LinearEquation class.




Test Case 1
Enter x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4:
2 2 5 -1.0 4.0 2.0 -1.0 -2.0
The intersecting point is at (2.88889, 1.1111)






Test Case 2
Enter x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4:
2 2 7 6.0 4.0 2.0 -1.0 -2.0
The two lines are parallel
